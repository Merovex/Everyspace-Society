The following is processed data based on the various terrains as reported in AE's Tables on Babylon server. Each Slot is an orbit, and the number in the "Slot-x" columns is the net number of available slots after subtracting the Urban Structures needed to populate and enough natural power plants (Solar, Gas) to provide the non-Urban, non-Plant area. Slot-1 is omitted because in every case it was the worst 

 To simplify the analysis, all slots are reduced by the value of the wost astro/slot on the table. (Note: not quite true for Metal-3 yet, but close.) The value shown is the number of additional available slots _above_ the number of available slots of the worst astro.
