        <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to {$:GuildName}. This guild recognizes that Astro Empires is a strategic war simulator. Economy is king because it fuels the war machines. As such, this guild takes a more militant approach to its activities. <strong>Our purpose is to attain the first rank for a guild in all categories.</strong></p>

<p>We recognize that you may be a veteran player. If not, we still welcome
you. Please read the <a href="/astro-empires/the-ten-seven-guide">Ten-Seven Guide</a> to build your
empire. This Policy Guide explains the guild&rsquo;s rank structure and
responsibilities, diplomatic philosophy, and member goals.</p>

<h1>Hierarchy</h1>

<p>The {$:GuildName} guild has a different rank structure than most. Typically,
guilds base rank off of economy, fleet size, etc. Astro Empire (AE) bases
rank off of a formula of economy, fleet and technology. Logically, a set
of ranks should derive from the AE levels as it is a superset of most
ranks structures. This causes one to wonder why exotic ranks are
created.</p>

<p>Because this is a military game, we adopt a hierarchy
of leadership. Players who are actively involved and able to lead others
are able to have a greater impact on the guild as a whole.</p>

<h2>Rank Structure</h2>

<p>Our ranks derive from the player&rsquo;s responsibility (discussed below). A
player choses to become responsible for peers and becomes a Section
Leader.  A Section Leader is developed to be a Fleet Leader when each of
his section members are themselves Section Leaders. Essentially, they
direct their section, and he directs them. A Fleet Leader is a Fleet
Leader whose section has become Section Leaders. The table below describes
this structure, and shows the insignia indicating a leader. Finally,
there are other indicators when a player is on probation or in jeopardy
of losing guild status.</p>

<table class='table'><tr>
  <th>Insignia</th>
  <th>Title</th>
  <th>Description</th>

<tr>
  <td>&#0198;</td>

  <td>Section Leader</td>
  <td>Responsible for 4 Members</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p><strong>Indicators:</strong>
* &#0222; Probation
* &#0215; In danger of being booted</p>

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Commander
~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>The Commander is an honorary title bestowed regardless of rank. The
Commander manages the overall guild activities and chairs the Fleet
Counsel.</p>

<p>Fleet Leader
~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Fleet Leaders manages activities with his team of Section Leaders.
They are authorized to engage in minor wars.
They are also guild recruiters.
They are responsible for ensuring their Section Leaders are adequately
involved in their sections, and for helping their Section Leaders to become
Fleet Leaders.
Fleet Leaders are responsible for enforcing discipline (kicking idle or
disciplinary players).
Fleet Leaders govern via the Fleet Counsel.
Because of the size of a Fleet is 20 members, a Fleet Leader commands
the guild presence in his galaxy.
During mobilization, he will work with his Section Leaders to identify and
prioritize targets within his sphere of influence. During war, he will
coordinate activities and shift focus as necessary.
Once a player is a fleet leader, he is expected to establish one base on
each galaxy in the guild&rsquo;s area of interest (AOI).</p>

<p>Section Leader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>A Section Leader directs his section members. He is responsible for ensuring
that his members have adequate defenses, and helps coordinate support
for when one of his section members is attacked.
During war, section work together in attack and defense.
When each section member has fully developed defenses and an adequate
attack fleet, the members may then begin taking on junior members and
become Section Leaders.
Section Leaders are responsible for identifying members of their section
who are idle or disciplinary problems.
During mobilization, the Section Leader designates targets and works
with his Fleet Leader to coordinate activities.
At war, the Section Leader will direct section activities and ensure all
members profit from the engagement.
A Section Leader must also maintain a current list of member bases and
report those base locations to the guild.
A Section Leader is considered &ldquo;Senior&rdquo; when his subordinates have
begun mentoring a total of nine new members.</p>

<h3>Section Member</h3>

<p>A Section Member is responsible for ensuring his bases are adequately
defended and that he builds an adequate attack fleet.
Adequacy is based on his tenure on Delta.
He must continually work to improve his economy.
He must report any combat he engages in (attack or defense).
At peace, he will help monitor rival bases in his region.
During mobilization, he will report on target base locations and fleet sizes.<br/>
At war, he will attack rival bases as directed and support section
members under attack.</p>

<h2>Administrative Duties</h2>

<p>The following are important administrative that Fleet Leaders and
Senior Section Leaders may assume. Generally speaking, these members are
responsible for obtaining and reporting information, or for smoothing
coordination for various activities. Some duties may be shared with more
junior players as the guild requires.</p>

<p>Quartermaster General (QMG)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>The Quartermaster General is responsible for coordinating fleet actions
and tracking guild Jump Gates. He solicits new base locations,
confirms guild ownership of known jump gates, and disseminates these
locations via the guild jump gate board <strong><em>weekly</em></strong>.</p>

<h3>Director of Publicity</h3>

<p>The Director of Publicity (DOP) is responsible for the guilds public
affairs activities on the Astro Empires forums. This includes routine
monitoring of the board for postings referring to {$:Guildname}, and
providing professional rebuttals as necessary. He will also announce
major guild activities. This is a high-energy duty.</p>

<h3>Director of Engineering</h3>

<p>The Director of Engineering (DOE) is responsible for maintaining the guild
policy for defenses and maintaining the master list of guild base
locations.</p>

<p>Director of Finance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>The Director of Finance (DOF) manages trade routes between guild members and with other friendly guilds. His mandate is to maximize guild member&rsquo;s incomes.</p>

<p>Director of Training
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>The Director of Training (DOT) ensures guild documentation on building a
successful empire is current and fully available to guild members. As
Astro Empires changes facets of game play (e.g. change values of unit
attributes), he will analyze the impact and share with the guild. (A
low-energy role.)</p>

<dl><dt><strong>Director of Intelligence (DOI)</strong></dt><dd> Responsible for monitoring rival fleets and updating guild maps.</dd>
<dt><strong>Director of Security (DOS)</strong></dt><dd> Not sure yet. Perhaps managing members assigned to monitor rival and allied guilds.</dd>
</dl>


<h1>Diplomacy</h1>

<p>This guild&rsquo;s diplomacy must always serve its constituency and stated
goal. Members will support guild diplomacy.</p>

<h2>Non-Aggression Pacts</h2>

<p>Non-Aggression Pacts (NAPs) is an agreement between two guilds to not
engage in all out war. These Pacts limit attacks against well-defended
bases. Non-Aggression Pacts must be agreed to by consensus of the Fleet
Leaders who have the rival guild&rsquo;s bases within their area of
responsiblity (AOR). For example, the other guild has presence in two
galaxies, both commanders must agree. If the guild expands into another
galaxy, then the NAP is open for reconsideration.
In the event a NAP is terminated, no hostilities may initiate for five
days.
Players who violate a NAP with another guild are vulnerable to that
guild&rsquo;s full retaliation. This is likewise true of the rival guild&rsquo;s
violator.</p>

<h2>Alliances</h2>

<p>Alliances are either offensive or defensive in nature. They should also
be designated as either permanent or for a fixed duration. New alliances
must be agreed to by unanimous consent of the Fleet Counsel.</p>

<h2>Cease Fires</h2>

<p>Cease fires are temporary actions meant to cool tempers. They are either
initiated to negotiate long-term peace, or to re-organize for resumption
of hostilities. The Fleet Counsel must agree to a cease fire by simple
majority.</p>

<h2>War</h2>

<p>Wars are either minor or major. Minor wars may be waged within a Fleet
Leader&rsquo;s AOR with guilds that will not drag {$:GuildName} into a larger
war. Major wars are all other wars. Minor wars must be agreed to by a
majority in the Fleet Counsel. Major wars require unanimity.</p>

<h2>Scout Taps</h2>

<p>This guild permits Scout taps for Section Members only. This is generally
because a Section Leader should normally have enough levels to not be able
to tap a rival player. However, the reason Leaders do not tap is in part
to allow junior players the opportunity to profit at another&rsquo;s lack of
preparation. Leaders are encouraged to announce Tappable locations so
members of their section may profit.</p>

<h2>Scrimages</h2>

<p>A Scrimage is an agreed upon war between guilds. They are typically of a
fixed duration. The purpose of a scrimage is to allow players to vent
off steam, build experience, and prepare for larger wars. A Scrimage
should be announced at least a week before it commences. It should be
limited in scope and last for not more than three days. Occupations and
fleets should be withdrawn when the Scrimage is complete.</p>

<h2>Other</h2>

<p>don&rsquo;t exploit the weak. Besides me, most members in my guild also tend to frown upon exploiting the weak. The only way to make profit is to have profitable battles, it does NOT have to be at the expense of weaker players. Taking down stronger or players in your level-range is FAR more fun.</p>

<p>{$:GuildName} encourages scout taps. Just be prepared to defend
yourself. Scout taps against member bases subjects that member to being
put on report. We encourage defense build-up by allowing guild members
to tap one-another. As a new member is assigned a Section Leader who is
responsible for him, taps should never occur.</p>

<h1>Member Goals</h1>

<p>As a member of our guild, you are expected to help us fulfill the
guild&rsquo;s goals. This section discusses goals a member must make to remain
in the guild. Overall, the member is obligated to keep his Section Leader
fully informed of his base locations and any situation that may impact
these goals.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>

<p>Members are encouraged to visit Delta at least daily. Please also glance
over the forum and check the [CHANGES] page for any changes to policy.
Inactivity for more than 3 days without prior notice to your next-level
superior risks expulsion.</p>

<h2>Defensive Fleet Goals</h2>

<table class='table'><tr>
  <th>Quality</th>
  <th>Size</th>
  <th>Extras</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Superb</td>
  <td>700x</td>
  <td>8x Disrupter Turrets, 20 Command Centers, P-Shield</td>

</table>


<p>There are several levels of defensive fleet quality. The table above
helps visualize the quality of fleets. Each month, a player should
attain the next level of fleet quality. Thus, a player should reach the
Adequate-quality fleet month by the end of his second month. It may be
helpful for the member to use the emboldened letter in his fleet
identifier to show its quality at a glance, although Fleets are
encouraged to adopt their own method as one method may reveal fleet
quality to rival guilds. Regardless, a scout taps against your bases are
not acceptable and you will be put on report.</p>

<p>The Standard
~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Each base must have at least a Good defensive fleet (500x Economy).
Thus, a base generating 100 economy needs a 50,000 defense fleet. With
this fleet, the base must have 10 Command Centers, four Disrupter
Turrets, and a Planetary
Shield.
A good ratio is 2000/100/50/1 (FT/CR/HC/BB), which generates a 57K
fleet. (That ratio is a &ldquo;Basic Fleet&rdquo;.) A base with less than Mediocre
fleet is considered undefended.</p>

<p>Initial
~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Obviously the ideal is difficult to attain. Players do not need to start
building fleet until Day 6. By that day, players should immediately
build 100 FT to cover their bases as well as one level of their best
turrets. The Initial goal must be met by Day 14. Players should then
start building a Minimal quality fleet.</p>

<p>Medial
~~~~~~</p>

<p>Once the initial defenses are established, the member should seek to
build a basic fleet.  A logical step between initial and medial defenses
is to build 1000 FT, then build the 100 CR, then 1000 FT (totalling 2000
FT), then 50 HC, then 1 BB. Once this fleet is built, the member should
expand the fleet by that ratio until the ideal fleet size is attained
for that base.</p>

<h2>Offensive Fleet Goals</h2>

<p>The offensive fleet goal is easier to describe. The ideal fleet goal is
a 500 fleet multiple for each base. That is, each base supports two
ideal defensive fleets&mdash;one is just offensive. Assuming you have ten
bases at 100 econ, that is a 500,000 point offensive fleet. Your total
fleet size is 1,000,000. By comparison, the highest fleet-ranked player
on Alpha has a 32.4 million point fleet. A good rule-of-thumb is to look
at your target rivals and have fifty percent more than you need to
defeat his fleets.</p>

<h2>Scouting</h2>

<p>Each member should keep track of rival bases within the Region of his
base. As one tenant of empire building is not to have more than one base
in a Region, this means that a player should be able to monitor at least nine
regions. There are 100 regions in a Galaxy. So, 11 players should be
able to keep tabs on an entire galaxy. That means that a Fleet should
easily be able to monitor and dominate a Galaxy. Naturally, section members
can negotiate monitoring activities.</p>

<p>When we mobilize, members will focus their attention on scouting guild
bases with whom we will war against. This includes calculating what is
necessary to occupy rival bases and optimizing an offensive fleet.</p>
