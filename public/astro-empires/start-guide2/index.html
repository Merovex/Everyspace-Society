</div>
      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Ok, so first of all, this is not my make, but I&rsquo;d rather say it&rsquo;s a compilation from various sources AND from my experience. Who am I? Search for &ldquo;Dacus&rdquo; in the beta server and you&rsquo;ll find out Wink
Also you can contact me for comments and improvements you might have to this.</p>

<p>A quick warning and very important too: DON&rsquo;T BUILD any defenses nor fleets (except one single fighter at all your bases which have at least one TR- this will prevent others to plunder your trade routes) during these 7 days, they are useless to you as in these 7 days you can&rsquo;t fight, you can&rsquo;t attack and you cannot be attacked, so bear in mind that you&rsquo;re losing money building those; money you can spend better in investing into your future empire. You should build however MAX 2 scouts to help you scout other regions you can&rsquo;t see and when you see good planets you want to take, bookmark them and then move on. In case you already used your bookmarks and there are no more bookmarks available (full list), just make notes and post there the coordinates.</p>

<p>&ndash;=&ndash;=&ndash;=&ndash;</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s get down to business. When you start a new account, it&rsquo;s preferred that you start on a moon, not a planet with at least 3 solar or gas and more than 4 fertility, unless you start on a crystalline type moon. I&rsquo;ll tell you why later.
So, until you get an astro with at least 5 fertility and at least 2 metal (best to be 3), and at least 2 solar or 2 gas (best will be at least one to be 4), you&rsquo;ll need to restart again. So the BEST target astro to start with is a Rocky-like astro and should be solar or gas >= 4 AND fertility >=5 AND metal 3 and DO NOT choose an asteroid as it&rsquo;s small area will hinder your future efforts of upgrading it.</p>

<p>Now that you have your base (Click on Bases, then Home Planet), click on structures and click build next to Metal Refineries. Then scroll down, there should be a queue structures button and a list of buildings you can queue. Queue up 1 Research lab and 4 metal refineries. Note that you may have to queue a power plant or an urban structure in between them. This is because each building takes up a certain amount of energy and 1 population. You can see those stats in the top of the page. Always build the power plant that gives more energy. Otherwise you&rsquo;re just wasting space. Add these only when you need them. Always remember to keep your queue list full, especially if you&rsquo;re going somewhere or going to sleep. The queue list will finish by itself unless you run out of credits or you messed the queue list up. And when you do run out of credits, the queue list activates when you do have the credits to build.</p>

<p>When that Research Lab was built, go to research and research Computer. Then queue 1 more Computer. While you&rsquo;re doing that, build a spaceport, then a shipyard. When your 2 computer research finishes, build a robotics factory.</p>

<p>This is the basics of what you should do on all your planets, except for the research labs and stuff.</p>

<p>Meaning, that after all this, you should have this:</p>

<p>Structures
1 Research Lab
4 Metal Refineries
1 Robotics Factory
1 Shipyard
1 Spaceport</p>

<p>In Queue:
Metal Refinery
Spaceport
Robotics Factory
Shipyard
Research Lab</p>

<p>And repeat. Add power plants and urban structures whenever necessary too. The specific order is because when you only focus on upgrading one structure, the cost steadily gets higher and your economy and construction won&rsquo;t be able to handle it. Alternating structures makes your economy and base stats grow faster and easier.</p>

<p>Research</p>

<p>2 Computer</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need that and 5 Research labs. Don&rsquo;t build them all at once, but slip them in the queue line every once in a while. Get them by the end of the day.</p>

<p>Now, this is what I expect if you started early:</p>

<p>5 Research Labs
7 Metal Refineries
4 Robotics
4 Shipyards
4 Spaceports</p>

<p>2 Computer</p>

<p>Go for 1 Energy and 5 more Energy in the queue.</p>

<p>If you started late, try to get that in queue and rest up for tomorrow.</p>

<hr />

<p>Second day, time to get to work. It&rsquo;s more building and research and if you were active, you might run out of credits today. This is what you should get by the end of the day, following the rule of alternating structure building:</p>

<p>8 Research Labs
10 Metal Refineries
6 Robotics Factories
6 Shipyards
6 Spaceports</p>

<p>Queue 2 shipyards and as many metal refineries as you can before you go to sleep. I&rsquo;d say 12 metal refineries on the planet is good.</p>

<p>8 Energy
2 Computer
4 Stellar Drive</p>

<p>If you didn&rsquo;t get 4 stellar drive, you&rsquo;re either bankrupt or not active. After you get 4 stellar drive, queue a Warp Drive. If you have 4 stellar but can&rsquo;t find Warp Drive, this is because you don&rsquo;t have 8 research labs.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re bankrupt, don&rsquo;t worry, the queue list will do your work for you while you&rsquo;re asleep.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before starting, read the whole tutorial again to remember the steps you need to take.</p>

<p>Day 3, now is the time to start building Outpost Ships. These require 8 Shipyards, 1 Warp Drive, and 100 credits on hand. Yes, the sole purpose of the above is to get Outpost Ships as early as possible. If you were able to get these on the second night, you&rsquo;re way ahead, and you have a pretty good chance of getting 10 planets before your account expires.</p>

<p>As a general rule it&rsquo;s a good idea to have 4 economy based astros, 3 Research based astros and 2 mixes Production&amp;Research astros (the first one you&rsquo;ll get will have to be Economy&amp;Production&amp;Research). As the game will progress you&rsquo;ll adjust your planets accordingly, but these are some kind of required for the long run.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d advise you to get the economy astros first to boost your economy (to help you expand), then the Prod&amp;Research astros and in the end the Research astros.</p>

<p>Outpost ships let you build new bases on other uninhabited planets. These are the suggested ones to build on:</p>

<p>Crystallines &ndash; Rare, but worth getting. I prefer crystallines with 3 solar and 5 fertility, but those are really rare. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t really care about the stats of them, but if they don&rsquo;t have those stats, you might have some problems with developing it. On this kind of planets a different kind of build is necessary. Ok, start always with metal refineries and robotic factory. and at the same time build crystal mines. you know metal refineries and robotic factory accelerate the building. when the crystal mines start getting expensive, alternate it with economic center (based on cost). and don&rsquo;t forget building good defense on it. Get AT MOST 4 of this kind, then go for something else.</p>

<p>Rocky &ndash; Pretty common, and are pretty good production bases. I prefer 3 solar and 6 fertility, but 4 solar and 5 fertility work fine too. I also prefer it being a moon instead of a planet (the reason why is at the end of this).</p>

<p>Metallic or Craters &ndash; Also common, and are also pretty good production bases. Don&rsquo;t pay much attention to the 1 crystal, as it&rsquo;s really not worth it. 3 solar and 5 fertility is what I&rsquo;d go for. I&rsquo;d also prefer a moon over a planet for this one as well.</p>

<p>Asteroids &ndash; Not as rare as Crystallines, but they&rsquo;re good to work with. Its only drawback is its small area. I&rsquo;d also prefer 3 solar and 5 fertility on this, because 4 fertility really hurts when you need to upgrade level 17 urban structures. These aren&rsquo;t as rare, so I do suggest finding these stats. try to alternate crystal mines with spaceports at the beginning. during this 7 days protection you need economy. after you could always change of discretion for production</p>

<p>If you started on a Rocky or Metallic, I&rsquo;d also suggest an Arid (or Tundra), Gaia (if you can get one) or Earthly or planet for your 10th planet to use it as your research base.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re setting up your new base, you&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s a fee. For your first base, it&rsquo;ll cost you 50 credits. Every base after the last will cost twice what it used to. Like so:</p>

<p>50
100
200
400
800</p>

<p>And so on. Your tenth planet will cost you 12800 credits. That sounds like a lot, but don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;ll be able to do it if you&rsquo;re pretty active.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve set up your base, follow the instructions from day 1 and 2, except without the research labs. These stats are what you should attain on all your planets, regardless of type:</p>

<p>12 Metal Refineries
8 Robotics
8 Shipyards
10 Spaceports</p>

<p>As for research, aim for this and this only:</p>

<p>10 Energy
10 Computer
8 Laser
4 Stellar Drive
1 Warp Drive</p>

<p>This will unlock Economic Centers and Nanite Factories. Build up to level 3 of both on all your bases. Remember to alternate.</p>

<p>I expect you to get a total of 3 bases by the end of the day and 2 more outpost ships in construction for tomorrow.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before starting, read the whole tutorial again to remember the steps you need to take.</p>

<p>Day 4, you should be starting to really rack in the credits with an economy of over 100. Use those outpost ships to get 2 more planets. You should have around 200 economy by the end of the day, maybe a little less. Build 2 more outpost ships for tomorrow.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before starting, read the whole tutorial again to remember the steps you need to take.</p>

<p>Day 5, you should have the credits to build your 6th base, and construct your 7th base by nightfall, which costs 1600 and 3200 credits. Remember to get all the above stats for all your planets. By the end of the day you should have about 400 economy or more. Build 3 more outpost ships.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before starting, read the whole tutorial again to remember the steps you need to take.</p>

<p>Day 6, this is the crucial day, and you should be able to build your 8th and 9th base in the afternoon and tomorrow morning. You must have around 650 economy and stop all construction and research a couple hours before your upgraded account ends.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before starting, read the whole tutorial again to remember the steps you need to take.</p>

<p>Day 7, spend all day waiting for 12800 credits and if you&rsquo;re worried, recycle some structures. Then build your 10th base. Feel free to do whatever you want from then on.</p>

<p>ADVICES
&ndash;=&ndash;=&ndash;=&ndash;</p>

<p>Keep in mind the following:</p>

<p>Very important: DON&rsquo;T BUILD any defenses nor fleets during these 7 days, they are useless to you as in these 7 days you can&rsquo;t fight and you can&rsquo;t attack, so bear in mind that you&rsquo;re losing money building those; money you can spend better in investing into your future empire. You&rsquo;ll have enough time to build fleets after these few start days.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, when the day 6 of your account is at the end, start building defenses and fleets on all your bases and stop constructing, so that you&rsquo;ll have money for your defenses:
1) fighters and Cruisers as fleet in the ratio 60 FTs to 1 CR. For example a good fleet for defense is 6000 FTs and 100 CRs
2) any turrets you can buy with shields (aim for the highest turret possible &ndash; early on disruptors if possible, later aim for the planetary rings). And don&rsquo;t build many shields &ndash; 1 batch maximum of each kind of shield. The idea is to hurt the invader Smile</p>

<p>Fertility is the amount of population you add when building Urban Structures.
As each building takes one people, you&rsquo;ll need a lot of people, and Urban Structures are getting very expensive.
Ex, Urban Structure level 20 cost you 3326 credits. But with a level 20 urban on a fertility 6 planet gives you a total of 20*6 = 120 people, whereas on a fertility 4 it gives you only 80 people.</p>

<p>A point for planet occupation, for each occupied planet you need one Command Center, so build some.</p>

<p>To occupy a planet, don&rsquo;t forget newbies have a 7 days protection
send corvettes or scouts to the nearby quadrants to seek acceptable targets (very low or no defense, no or small fleet).
You can only attack people who have account start > 7 and (their player level &ndash; your player level) %3c 10
When you find a target, send a sufficient fleet to conquer the base. In the beginning you should find people conquerable with a single corvette but soon you&rsquo;ll need more (some corvettes and destroyers).
Conquer the base.
Conquered bases give you credit by first pillage, then pillage once per day, and you take 30%25 of their economy.
Keep a small fleet above the planet, the occupied people will try to make fleets to free their planets. We call that &lsquo;popping debris&rsquo; Wink</p>

<p>there are other rules about level of protection when you get into the higher degrees, but that&rsquo;s going to happen a lot later, so I&rsquo;ll not describe here</p>

<p>at first, have focused bases.
one for top science,
one for top ship building,
some just for econ (i.e. crystallines or asteroids)
and as you get high in each base&rsquo;s focus, start building up other aspects of that base.
put jump gate on your best shipyard bases&hellip;
your standard hybrid is a shipyard/research mix, but all bases should be making as much econ as they can, and should keep construction speeds up&hellip;
and don&rsquo;t forget defenses&hellip;</p>

<p>Why moons and not planets?
1) On a moon the costs for building planetary rings and planetary shields is a LOT less &ndash; believe me it&rsquo;s worth the extra cash you&rsquo;re saving
2) On a moon the cost of Bio Mod is a lot less &ndash; the same as above
3) Moons are not so searched for, as people hurry for the planets, so you&rsquo;re going to have a variety of moons to choose from Smile</p>

<p>You should choose planets and not moons ONLY when you have NO intention of upgrading. Planets offer you more space so they are more suitable for free accounts. However, in case you can&rsquo;t upgrade I advise you to contact other people who are upgraded and offer them something in return (in-game or in real-life), so that they upgrade your account too. Believe me, this game is worth to be played while upgraded Smile So beg from your parents, your spouse or from your siblings to get you upgraded Smile</p>
