<h1>Rules for Insuring Privacy in an Organization</h1>

<p>CONSTANT AWARENESS OF THREATS.</p>

<p>The following is a brief abstract on the topic of privacy and the awareness
of threats and vulnerabilities.  I shall in this text discuss some of the
common rules that security experts and countermeasures technicians live by.</p>

<p>I have found that the best set of rules published to date is by
Glen H. Whidden which he draws upon from his 28-year career with the CIA.
Mr. Whidden, noted as one of the countries most knowledgeable surveillance
countermeasures experts details these rules in the books which his company
Technical Services Agency (TSA) publishes.</p>

<p>I shall simply reprint these rules from his book  <em>A Guidebook for the Beginning Sweeper</em>.   Mr. Whidden has  lovingly given his rules a name,
and that is:  &ldquo;The Moscow Rules&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t  know what it specifically
means. Nothing really, just a clever slogan. but anyway the rules are
as follows.</p>

<h2>Moscow Rules for Counter Espionage Investigations</h2>

<h1>Assume that all Local Nationals&rsquo;s (LN)are hostile.</h1>

<h1>Assume that an approach by a non-LN is hostile until proven otherwise.</h1>

<h1>Assume that there is always hostile physical surveillance unless counter-surveillance proves otherwise.</h1>

<h1>Assume that all telephone conversations are monitored by LN&rsquo;s.</h1>

<h1>Assume that all enclosed areas are bugged unless they are &lsquo;secure&rsquo; rooms.</h1>

<h1>Assume that incoming and outgoing mail will be subject to hostile examination.</h1>

<h1>Assume that anything that is left unattended will be subject to examination by LN&rsquo;s.</h1>

<h1>Assume that locks left unguarded or unprotected will be manipulated or bypased and the material they protect will be compromised.</h1>

<h1>Assume that simple traps will not deceive LN&rsquo;s.</h1>

<h1>Assume that any guard can be recruited by LN&rsquo;s or is himself an LN agent.</h1>

<h1>Assume that a pair of guards can be recruited by LN&rsquo;s or are themselves agents of LN&rsquo;s.</h1>

<h2>Moscow Rules for Countermeasures Inspections</h2>

<h1>Assume that the eavesdropper is listening in the sensitve areas.</h1>

<h1>Assume that an eavesdropper has an agent near the sensitive area.</h1>

<h1>Assume that the eavesdropper is watching the entrances of the facility.</h1>

<h1>Assume that the eavesdropper can maintain a low vulnerability status when he is not listening.</h1>

<h1>Assume that the eavesdropper is guarding the NLJD band of frequencies.</h1>

<h1>Assume that the eavesdropper is watching for sweep receiver radiation.</h1>

<h2>Translation into English</h2>

<p>Mr Whidden, then goes onto explain what each one of the above rules
means in detail, but it is rather long-winded and I wont reprint it
in this text.  Most of the rules are very simpe to understand, but
a few points warrant explanation which I&rsquo;ll put into my own words so
I can explain it in more simplistic terms.</p>

<p>Local Nationals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>The term  LN (Local National) means a person who is indigenous to a
specific area.  This term has a greater meaning in the field of world
intelligence as it means a citizen of a foreign country who may be an
agent or informer of that country or it may be a citizen of another
country that you recruit as an &ldquo;agent&rdquo; or &ldquo;asset&rdquo; to work for you.</p>

<p>However, in the context of the Moscow Rules it is simply a term of
convenience which is not nearly so grand. In such context of the rules
it refers to a person who may work for an organization or a corporation
who is either acting on its own accord or under the direction of others
and the purpose of that individual is to infiltrate and or compromise
the corporation or organization usually in a covert manner (such as to
steal business secrets in industrial espionage), but can be done in an
overt manner also if the intent is to destroy or cause harm or embarress
the organization.</p>

<h1>Moscow Rules for Counter Espionage Investigations</h1>

<h3>Rule One</h3>

<p>Rule 1 &ldquo;Assume all Local Nationals are hostile&rdquo; translates to the
philosophy of &ldquo;trust nobody!&rdquo;
This can be extended to include the very person who hired you.<br/>
This is a logical conclusion when you strictly construe these rules;
especially in a corporate situation.</p>

<p>One interesting tactic has the security detail request that a TSCM
countermeasures sweep be performed. They may request the sweep to
satisfy a boss or to make the executives feel that the room is more
secure after the sweep so they will have a confidential converation.
However, one or more of the security detail may be the actual
perpetrator and either deactivate or remove the clandestine devices
before the search, and reactivate or replace the device afterwards.
What makes this tactic more powerful is the target will trust the agent
for ordering the sweep. This also makes the agent&rsquo;s cover appear more
legitimate becuase he ordered the sweep.
One should consider Moscow Rules 10 &amp; 11 to accept that &ldquo;guards&rdquo; and
&ldquo;security&rdquo; should not never be given full trust.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Sweeper&rdquo; <em>must</em> obey the security staff, even if the sweeper
suspects the guards or security staff as being the actual perpetrators.
Once actual proof reveals that a staffer or guard is an agent, the
sweeper should convey that possibility to some other person within the
company who the sweeper feels is trustworthy.</p>

<h3>Rule 4</h3>

<p>Rule 4 is an especially important one. &ldquo;Assume all telephone
conversations are monitored.&rdquo; Although it needs no elaboration, I cannot
stress how important it is <strong>never</strong> to discuss anything sensitive
over a telephone. This holds espeicially true when you have a cordless
or cellular phone.</p>

<p>Also, it should also be noted in my personal opinion, that not even
encrypted phones/faxes should be beyond suspicion. There exists many
ways to defeat such encryption. The easiest is simply to compromise the
keys which is not a difficult task if your target is unaware. A simple
blag-bag job is all that is needed to either liberate the codes from the
encryption unit itself or from a locked safe or drawer which can then be
copied to floppy and the original code returned to its position
undisturbed.  Modern encryption units such as the STU phones do help to
some small extent to guard against such attacks by the uses of
&ldquo;ignition or code keys&rdquo; which can be physically taken from the unit to
help secure the units key integrity, but there are ways around that.
Then of course, it is never beyond reason to doubt that the encryption
itself can be cracked if it is deemed a priority. This is a mere simple
task which can be done in a half a second if your using weak encryption
on your phone such as simple &ldquo;inversion&rdquo; chips or other simple
encryption units which are widly sold in catalogs.  It is also not out
of reason to realize that even DES is not safe anymore, although its a
hell of alot safer than &ldquo;inversion chips&rdquo; which can be cracked with a
$50 kit available in the classifieds of most electronic magazines.</p>

<h3>Rule 5</h3>

<p>Rule 5 states that all conversations should be considered vulnerable
unless conducted in a &ldquo;secure&rdquo; room.   Personally, I hold to the
philosophy that <em>there is no such thing</em> as a &ldquo;secure&rdquo; room, but then one
must realize that this is reality and you cannot be completely paranoid.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;secure&rdquo; room is a complicated term to define as there are many
degrees of what is considered &ldquo;secure&rdquo;.  The ultimate &ldquo;secure&rdquo; room
would be completely RF (Radio Frequency) proof and would thusly
attenuate completely all RF transmissions from &ldquo;bugs&rdquo;, but the security
must be extended to insure that no wires/fiber enter the room or leave
the room as they can carry clandestine signals hidden on that wire (or
at the very least all wires must be monitored for hidden signals). The
room must have no loudspeakers which can act as microphones, the room
preferable would have no windows and if it did would attenute any
Infrared light so as to protect against RF/IR transmitters. And lastly
the room would be acoustically secure which means there would be
virtually no acoustic leakage (in otherwords no sound could be heard on
the other side of the wall using any types of devices such as
microphones and high powered amplifiers.) Also, to be acoustically
secure, the room should have sufficient random masking signals present
and continuously fed into the secure room. There should be several of
such masking generators in use at different points in the room and in
addition all plenums and air vents should be masked as well. In
addition, the walls as well as any windows should be masked using a
transducer element which vibrates all windows and walls in a random
fashion to further defeat any clandestine listening devices such as
contact microphones, spike or tube microphones which are drilled into
the wall from the opposite non-guarded side, as well as techniques of
&lsquo;laser/microwave pick-off&rsquo;.</p>

<h3>Rule 8</h3>

<p>Rule 8 also warrants elaboration. All mechanical locking mechanisms are
easily bypassed by persons with experience in such fields &ndash; which very
often includes an eavesdropper himself &ndash; or on occasion, an eavesdropper
may have a  &ldquo;keyman&rdquo;  which is a person who is an entry specialist
(called &ldquo;quick-entry&rdquo; in the locksmithing field).</p>

<p>To properly secure a facility electronic locking mechanisms should be
used which are much harder (yet not impossible to defeat).  Preferably a
secure installation should go beyond simple electronic locking
mechanisms (such as key card system connected to an electric strike). A
complete access system must be incorporated with full provisions for
software logging of all entries and exits, as well as &ldquo;anti-passback&rdquo;
protection to further enhance accountability and security and tracking.</p>

<p>All safes should be of the electronic type, NOT the mechanical
combination type of yesteryear.  It is not a difficult task to bypass
combination safes nowadays.  The top expert safecrackers can ply their
trade in an hour to two hours time, and a device now exists on the
market which cracks safes automatically using a computer controlled
mechanism and does so in approximately 1 hour.  Electronic safes are
virtually 100 percent secure and are the current standard on all
government facilities where classified information is stored. The
electronic safe itself should preferably have accountability and logging
features built-in with seperate access codes for multiple users of that
safe.</p>

<h2>MOSCOW RULES FOR COUNTERMEASURES INSPECTIONS:</h2>

<h3>Rule 3</h3>

<p>Rule 3 is a most important one and is something both the countermeasures
technician as well as his client should keep in mind and previously
discuss during the initial client contact. Although it does not suit
every situation, but in many cases it would be wise not to be recognized
as a countermeasures technician for obvious reasons.  One does not want
to spook the eavesroppers into either shutting their devices off,
pulling them out temporarily or at worst &ldquo;skipping town&rdquo; never to be
heard from, and unlikely to be caught.</p>

<p>Q: How does a countermeasures technician arrive at his clients office in a discreet manner?</p>

<p>When it is deemed necessary, a simple &ldquo;disguise&rdquo; is in order.  The TSCM
Tech should blend in to look like all other employees, he should look
and act like all employees, and in fact NO EMPLOYEES except a select few
should even know the TSCM techs are who they are.  The TSCM tech should
arrive in a vehichle preferable a &ldquo;work&rdquo; vehicle which can be disguised
as either a maintenance or utility company vehicle.</p>

<p>All equipment should be carried in, under concealment. This means that
some type of discreet yet common bag should be used to carry the
equipment in.  It is obviously suspicious for a person to carry in 5
briefcases (some of them being oversized cases indicating to the
eavesdropper that its no &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; briefcase) into a building.</p>

<p>One tactic I have personally used myself when doing the occasional sweep
for a client,  is to arrive in a borrowed van which bears the name of
some maintenance company.  My typical motife is to arrive as a
&ldquo;painter&rdquo; and when I enter the office if its a large office I announce
myself as such to the secretary. This of course must be made clear in
advance to the client so that the secretary knows that the  &ldquo;painter&rdquo;
(or &ldquo;plumber&rdquo; or &ldquo;carpentry contractor&rdquo; will arrive), again it should
be stressed that not even secretaries should be made aware of the TSCM
Techs identity or purpose of visit.  All equipment I carry in discreetly
in a  painters spackle bag which is just large enough for most of my
sweep gear. And for my spectrum analyzer which is too large for the
spackle bag, I just haul that into the office discreetly wrapped up in a
large painters cloth tarp.</p>

<p>Usually I strip the plates off of the van and I remove the inspection
and registration sticker so as to avoid being &ldquo;checked-out&rdquo; by an LN
agent who may find your van &ldquo;suspicous&rdquo;.  This in actuallity IS NOT THE
IDEAL METHOD. I merely do that for convenience purposes.  (because I am
not rich I cant afford multiple vans and vehicles registered to multiple
legitimate &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; companies which all must pay taxes and be registered
with the state you do business in.) In fact its better to arrive in a
van which  has license plates and registration which is legitimate as
well as the company logo painted on the side of the truck belonging to
an established legal business. This provides a better degree of cover.
Although it is very very rare, it should likewise not be considered out
of the question that an LN might ckeck out the validity of your company
(a simple check of the yellow pages should turn up your company name.
and if not&hellip;suspicion.)  It doesnt take a genius likewise to figure out
that if you see a white van marked  &ldquo;Acme Painting Company&rdquo; parked in
front of your target building which you are eavesdropping upon, you
should become suspicious.</p>

<blockquote><p>(4) Assume that the eavesdropper can maintain a low vulnerability status when he is not listening.</p></blockquote>

<p>What rule number 4 deals with, is the eavesdroppers ability to make
himself &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; to the TSCM Technician, Security Staff and his
intended &ldquo;targets&rdquo; by various methods too detailed to describe here.</p>

<p>This mainly includes 2 tactics.
 * shutting the taps or bugs off remotely  (and)
 * having an LN agent remove the taps/bugs after they are</p>

<pre><code> no longer needed and then promptly replacing them when they
 are needed again. It merely takes seconds for an agent who
 has access to the facilities to install such devices in the
 compromoised area.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>(5) Assume that the eavesdropper is guarding the NLJD band of frequencies.</strong></p>

<p>This one is a bit esoteric to the laymen, but the term NLJD refers to
a device which is used by countermeasures technician to locate
clandestine listening devices which may be buried under concealment
inside of a wall, desk, drawer, behind books, buried covertly inside
a piece of wood or other structural material which could not be inspected
by any other means.</p>

<p>The NLJD works much like a metal detector, only the principle involved is
ALOT more sophisticated. The device doesnt merely search for metal.
Rather, it searches for semiconductor junctions such as transistors and
diodes which would be present in all &ldquo;bugs&rdquo; (transmitters) as well as
in most microphones, etc.  The NLJD is mainly usefull for finding a
clandestine device which is NOT ACTIVATED!   This has to do with one of
the rules above (Rule #4). The eavesdropper may have the ability to
turn the device off remotely or even manually and as such would not
be detected with normal RF &ldquo;sweeping&rdquo; gear which looks for an RF/IR signal.
(since if the device is OFF, it thusly generates no RF/IR signal).</p>

<p>The NLJD works by transmittng a microwave frequency signal (between
800 &ndash; 950MHz  [depending on the version, and the laws of the country
which the unit is sold in]. The signal power of these units is
relatively low 20mW &ndash; 300mW for non-government (&ldquo;consumer&rdquo;/industry)
versions [legal U.S.A versions a.k.a FCC approved]  and  300mW to approx
3 Watts for law enforcement and government units. The greater output power
of the government models allows a higher degree of penetration into deeply
embedded or dense materials. The typical radiated ouput for a U.S.A. version
NLJD is 915MHz and for European versions is often 888.5MHz.</p>

<p>Since the unit emits a microwave it thusly radiates through the airwaves
and the eavesdropper can thusly detect it using his scanner. A clever
eavesdropper will continuously scan the band of frequencies, or a specific
frequency if the eavesdropper is relatively sure of the frequency on which
the targets NLJD uses. Once the eavesdropper detects the signal, he can then
remotely deactivate his clandestine devices.</p>

<p>It should be noted of course, that a clever eavesdropper has at their
disposal, a number of uniquely different methods in which to &ldquo;fool&rdquo; an
NLJD unit into not detecting the listening device completely, or methods to
fool the user of the NLJD into believing that the reflected signal is a
false alarm. One example is to modify the casing of the listening device,
and RF filter all the leads when done in such a manner that they clandestine
device will reflection a large portion of 3rd harmonics while keeping
secondary harmonics to a minimum thus indicating to the NLJD user perhaps
that the unit is picking up disimilar metals (sheetrock screws, nails, rebar,
etc.) rather than semiconductors.</p>

<p>I shall not detail these particular processes as its irrelevant and unwise
but if anyone actually cares to know the methods are I can discuss that with
you in more detail if you ask.</p>

<p><strong>(6) Assume that the eavesdropper is watching for sweep receiver radiation.</strong></p>

<p>This is a bit more esoteric and its something which I dont feel is
any great threat. But their might be some government experts in the
field who are a bit more sophisticated who would say otherwise. But
in a real life situation I dont see it happening unless the
eavesdropper is himself a former government employee.</p>

<p>ALL electronic equipment generates EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)
which is essentially spurious radiation emmited unintentionally. As such
these radio wave emmisions are also generated from any type of &ldquo;sweep&rdquo;
equipment which the countermeasures technician may use.
A sophisticated eavesdropper can detect these spurious emmisions and
take it as a sign that sweep equipment is being used and the sweep is
now in progress. The eavesdropper then shuts his clandestine devices
off remotely.</p>

<p>In reality the ability to do this is actually quite simple. Its just
that I find it unrealistic and I dont think many buggist in this country
go to all that trouble. Not unless its a super sophisticated operation,
or unless the eavesdropper is being payed well to take such precautions.
But then super sophisticated operations are not the norm. Not even close.
Usually the bugging is done by amateurs using crude bugging equipment
which is easily detected, and is not even concealed well on top of it.
Most bugging devices are usually not even remotely activated and likewise
their usually not protected against NLJD sweeps either, unless the person
who is doing the eavesdropping is a pro which is rarely the case.</p>

<h2>Moscow Rules for Telephone System Inspections</h2>

<h1>Assume that the eavesdropper is listening to room sounds through the telephone instrument until tests prove otherwise.</h1>

<h1>Assume that the eavesdropper is listening across the line when the line is active.</h1>

<h1>Assume that the eavesdropper may be monitoring the line when it is inactive.</h1>

<h1>Assume that the eavesdropper is monitoring the line to detect TDR and RF tracing signals.</h1>

<h2>Moscow Rules for Telephone System Inspections:</h2>

<h1>The eavesdropper has a variety of techniques at his disposal which enable him to listen to &lsquo;room sounds&rsquo; (&ldquo;room audio&rdquo; [note 1]) from a remote location. I will not discuss that in detail, because all the techniques involved in telephone and wireline attacks could fill an entire book in itself.  Generally however, their are two main techniques that could be employed. [Their are actually another 3 or 4 techniques but I shant get into discussing those for the sake of brevity.]</h1>

<h2>&lsquo;Hot-miked telephone&rsquo; otherwise called a &lsquo;Hot-On-Hook telephone&rsquo; is one method, which involves modifying an actual telephone which is in a targets location (in reality, the targets phone itself is not modified, but an identical replacement is brought in and switched with the original [this technique of switching phones of course warrants caution as the target could possibly notice the difference between the two by noting scuff marks, etc. that were on the original phone]. The modification consists of a circuit that will allow the eavesdropper to listen to room sounds while the phone is still &ldquo;on-hook&rdquo;. The modification &ldquo;drops-out&rdquo; once the phone is picked up for use and is brought &ldquo;off-hook&rdquo; (in which case, the eavesdropper would then have a seperate circuit which could monitor the phone conversation.</h2>

<h2>The second most common method is called an &ldquo;infinity transmitter&rdquo;, which in the &lsquo;olden days&rsquo; circa 1960/70 was called a &ldquo;harmonica bug&rdquo;.  This is a slight variation of the hot-miked telephone. It is similar in that it allows a person to listen to room audio from a remote location, however the system employed need not be part of the actual telephone. The device could be hidden anywhere along the phone line in close proximity to the target where a seperate microphone can listen to room audio which is then sent through the phone lines while the phone is &lsquo;on-hook&rsquo;. When the phone is lifted &lsquo;off-hook&rsquo;, the device drops-out. The device is activated remotely by the eavesdropper by simply calling the targets phone line and then activating the device.</h2>

<p>Room sounds could also be monitored by simply placing a microphone
across any line pair, preferably a line pair which is not currently
activated for phone useage (ie: the second yellow-black pair.) This
would allow constant monitoring of the room audio even when the target
uses the phone (which would be on line pair 1 (red-green) and thusly
would not conflict. The microphone could either generate its own signal
9which has the disadvantage of being easier to detect because the
microphone transmits constantly , or could use a microphone element
which requires an external voltage such as in a carbon mic.  In the case
of carbon microphones, the eavesdropper need only apply a small voltage
to the line and the microphone will activate sending intercepted audio
down the line. The device has the advantage that it is slightly harder
to detect (especially inadvertently) because the unit only operates when
the eavesdropper has the device activated.  Countermeasures technicians
can find the device (in its simplest form) easy enough by just applying
voltage to the line. But more sophisticated set-ups would utilize a
4-layer diode, SCR, or a reverse polarity configuration or some other
method to hinder and thwart detection.</p>

<p><strong>(2) Rule 2 is fairly obvious and needs little explanation. Always
assume that a phone line can be, or currently is being monitored.</strong></p>

<p>It is very important for the laymen to make the distinction between the
two facts in the above statement which are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the phone/line &ldquo;could&rdquo; be tapped.</li>
<li>the phone/line &ldquo;is being&rdquo; tapped.</li>
</ul>


<p>It does not make one paranoid to come to the conclusion and realization
that a phone &ldquo;could&rdquo; be tapped. It merely makes one alert and an
informed individual.  That does not mean that one should insist that a
line &ldquo;is&rdquo; tapped, but it should simply be considered a possibilty which
one must take into consideration and act accordingly on.</p>

<p>Thusly, if one conducts confidential business in which it would be of
important consequence to keep the conversation from prying ears of the
eavesdropper, one should always employ end-to-end encryption through the
use of telephone/fascimile &ldquo;scramblers&rdquo;. [note 2]</p>

<p>One must make the decision for themselves regarding what is to be kept
secret and what can be disclosed, and you must come to some sort of plan
of action regarding what the different levels of confidentiality are.
Some secrets are worth keeping more than others. In fact one might even
say some secrets are so great that you should not disclose them to
anyone ever. That would be the ultimate form of security. As an example,
if you had just murdered someone, obviously any sane individual should
not announce that over the phone lines, no matter how secure you feel
that phone line is. Because their is no degree of security which is
worth 25 years in prison or death. Even encryption (phone scramblers)
should not be considered secure in such cases as they can be compromised
rather easily by simply bypassing the encryption altogether through
modification by the eavesdropper, or by simply liberating the code keys
from the unit (which is a simple task with some encryption units while
alot more difficult in the better units.)</p>

<p>Whenever a line pair is to be examined or traced (for maintenance
purposes such as working on a phone or computer network in an office
or home, or when a countermeasures search is being done, it is preferable
that &ldquo;audio&rdquo; signals of a strange nature (line tracing signals) should
NOT be placed across the line as they would be suspicious to an eavesdropper
in which case the eavesdropper might deactivate remotely any devices
which he may have installed which could put the devices in a low-profile
status making them more difficult to detect.</p>

<p>So how then does one trace a line without using an &ldquo;audible line tracer&rdquo;
as is the standard method among technicians?  The alternative is to
use either an RF (Radio Frequency) tracer system which is relatively
inexpensive (and also has many advatages over audible tracers such as
the ability to track wires through walls without having to open up the wall
or structure for physical examination) or one could utilize an &ldquo;ultrasonic&rdquo;
tracer device which sends an inaudible signal down the line. These
aultrasonic tracers are an indespensible tool which come in two forms.
The first is simply a aultrasonic tone tracer and merely produces a
single tone for identifying line pairs. The second type of ultrasonic
device actually modulates a voice signals onto a wire pair so that it
is inaudible and above both the range of human hearing and likewise
cannot be picked up by either microphones of any type and cannot be
demodulated by any type of standard amplifier unit which is not designed
to amplify sounds above the standard human hearing/speaking range.
Only a specialized matching ultrasonic demodulation amplifier can
intercept and convert the signals back into the human hearing range.</p>

<p>Keep in mind with the above however, that rule #3 below shall apply.
Rule #3 states that the eavesdropper &ldquo;may&rdquo; be able to hear your line
tracing with the phone on-hook.  So one has to balance this
consideration out. Nine times out of Ten you would be better off sending
these signals down the line because most eavesdroppers DO NOT monitor
a phone which is on-hook, nor do they look for signals on inactive lines
(not unless they are professionals, or are simply getting payed alot
of money to do that extra work which is often unnecessary).
But if your up against a sophisticated eavesdropper and you know of
his capabilities it would probably be wise in such case NOT to send any
strange signals down a wire pair other than ordinary phone conversations.</p>

<p>(3) Most of the time, telephone surveillance, whether it be the</p>

<pre><code>interception of phone conversations where the phone is off-hook,
or even monitoring of room conversations when the line is on-hook
involves the use of some sort of "activation" device which records
the conversations when and only when those conversations are present.
When the conversation ceases the device will shut itself off (usually)
so as to conserve tape (and in addition make it easier for the
eavesdropper to find the conversations in the recorded tapes.
</code></pre>

<p>When dealing with recording telephone calls, a device is used which
monitors the voltage on the line for off-hook/on-hook conditions and
then activates a special tape recorder (with a remote activation jack)
when the phone goes off-hook. [although a more clever eavesdropper would
not use such a device but would rather use a VOX (voice [sound level]
activated unit as opposed a voltage sensing unit which can actually be
&ldquo;tricked&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;detected&rdquo; alot more easily which should be
coupled to an inductive pick-up coil (or at the least a high-impedance
capacitively coupled interface). VOX units too also have their problems,
namely they can have havoc wreaked upon them by the use of masking
devices or &ldquo;telephone security units&rdquo; which are now widely sold on the
market for a couple hundred dollars. These telephone security units have
the ability to defeat most simple eavesdropping methods utilizing
techniques such as masking as well as &ldquo;Line Balancing&rdquo;. The latter
technique of balancing performed by raising the voltage, while the
current is simultaneously lowered.  Such a technique does not interfere
with the PSTN Central Office and will give the user a dial-tone when the
line is raised off-hook(600 Ohms) and will thusly defeats most voltage
activated devices such as simple telephone tap transmistters as well as
drop-out relays (telephone recorder controllers).</p>

<p>The foolish individual could conclude that if most eavesdroppers used a
voltage activated device that only recorded audio when the phone was
&ldquo;off-hook&rdquo;, then the line should be secured in an &ldquo;on-hook&rdquo; condition.
Example, a person could then transmit his voice within the household or
office while the phone was still &ldquo;on-hook&rdquo; using a relatively simple
circuit to do that and &ldquo;supposedly&rdquo; that would alow for safe
conversation, and it would be safe &ldquo;if&rdquo; a voltage activated telephone
recording adapter was used.  However, many eavesdroppers (sophisticated
ones) may be a bit more clever than that. The clever eavesdropper may
monitor a line pair even when it is inactive (such as when a phone is
&ldquo;on-hook&rdquo;.) This would allow the eavesdropper to hear  &ldquo;AUDIO&rdquo; [note
1] even when the phone is off-hook.  Note I use the word AUDIO very
carefully. Because in such an instance, the eavsdropper may NOT just be
listening to secret conversations which occur &ldquo;on-hook&rdquo; but he may be
listening to other audio which could be a potential threat to the
eavesdropper such a the sounds of audible line tracing, ultrasonic line
tracing or ultrasonic voice modulation, as well as RF tracing, and
lastly the eavesdropper could be looking for the signals emmenating from
a TDR (see rule #4 explanation).</p>

<p>(4) The last rule is a rather esoterical one which is of more concern to
the countermeasures technician who is performing the search as opposed
to concern of your ordinary individual or businessman concerned with the
rules to insuring privacy.</p>

<p>Rule #4 is just a follow up to rule #3 which states that an eavesdropper
could possibly be monitoring the inactive line pair. In rule #4 we get
specific in saying that an eavesdropper may be looking for RF signals or
TDR signals which may be an indication of a countermeasures &ldquo;sweep&rdquo;
which is being conducted. This should concern the eavesdropper for
obvious reasons, which are that he could possibly be discovered very
soon if the technician is a competant one, or if the eavesdroppers
set-up is crude or poorly installed in which case it could possibly be
detected.</p>

<p>I have already explained ultrasonic and RF tracing above in rule 3, so
I&rsquo;ll just deal with TDR&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>A TDR is common abbreviation for a device known as a Time Domain
Reflectometer. You pronounce the units name by simply saying the
letters.   &ldquo;T&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;D&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The TDR is a common tool of anyone who works exensively with wires (or
fiber optic cabling) of any type. The type of TDR we are discussing is
only for the &ldquo;wire&rdquo; and not &ldquo;fiber optic&rdquo; type.  TDR&rsquo;s are used by
cable company technicians, computer network technicians, telephone
lineman or repair personell, as well as surveillance countermeasures
technicians.</p>

<p>A TDR is a device (usually a hand-held size device although slightly
larger and more powerfull bench-top units are available) which emits a
mild powered signal into a wire pair. This signal gets sent down a wire
pair, or through a coaxial cable and gets partially reflected off of any
discontinuity on the line pair. Herein, I&rsquo;ll refer to any discontinuous
reflections as an &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo; on the wire. I use the word as opposed to
discontinuity (because its easier to type) and because much like an
anomoly it is indicative of the unknown. And thats what your looking for
when doing a TSCM TDR sweep of a wire pair.  Your looking for unknown or
strange situations.  It is these anomalies which the technician is
looking for which are a possible source of the problem (or could even
indicate that everything is normal if their is supposed to be an anomoly
at some point).</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo; is a generic term which refers to anything on the
line which will interfere with the signal going through the line.  To
put it another way, it is something which causes part of the signal to
literally reflect backwards from the point of origin instead of
traveling freely and smoothly through the wire.</p>

<p>This &ldquo;reflection&rdquo; of the signal is what the TDR is looking to receive
after it emits the original pulse. The reflection which could be of
varying degrees of intensity depending on how large the anomaly is.  The
larger the anomaly, the larger the reflection, and occasionaly that
means the bigger the problem. Ideally the signal is supposed to travel
through the wire impeded as little as possible.  Anomalies are caused by
a wide variety of things too great to discuss here. They can be caused
by imperfections in the wire itself, they can be caused by splices in
the line, they can be caused by &ldquo;connectors&rdquo; on a wireline which join 2
wires together or a wire to a piece of equipment. Anomalies can be
caused by &ldquo;termination plugs&rdquo; which are a dummy loads placed at the end
of a unused wirepair. Anomalies can also be caused by physical hardware
on the line such as splitters, filters, junction boxes, 66/110blocks,
entrance bridges, and the list can go on and on.</p>

<p>The countermeasures technician is primarily interested in looking for
things such as splices on the line which could be indicative of a
telephone tap.  Keep in mind, that the word &ldquo;splice&rdquo; does not
necessarily preclude that a line was physically &ldquo;spliced&rdquo; (ie: cut and
then re-connected.) It also can imply a simple &ldquo;tap&rdquo; on the line where
one wire (alligator clip, etc.) is touching upon the original wireline.
TDR&rsquo;s have a typical range of 1,000 &ndash; 10,000 feet. A typical handheld
TDR used by computer network installers will have ranges of 1,000 &ndash; 2k
feet. Countermeasures technicians often utilize slightly more powerfull
models extending 2,000 &ndash; 5,000 feet so they can have the ability to
trace large amounts of wires present in office buildings. And benchmodel
units which are usually the most powerfull (although some handheld units
are capable of such) can extend upwards of 10,000 or more feet.  These
units can pinpoint  &ldquo;flaws&rdquo; or &ldquo;anomalies&rdquo; on a wireline to a
resolution of millimeters which makes them damned accurate devices which
can tell you exactly where the flaw is down the line. (typically however
in high powered devices the resolution is limited to feet or meters).</p>

<p>The TDR is most effective when it is used on a routine basis and a
day-to-day (or more likely week-to-week or moth-to-month) comparison can
be made between the different or same results.  Ideally, the results of
the TDR should always be the same.  Should a result be significantly
different on one occasion, or something appears to have been
spliced/tapped onto the line it will be readily apparent.</p>

<p>Of course for the TDR test to be most effective, it should be realized
that the initial tests of the TDR must be done when the line was
&ldquo;clean&rdquo;.  If the line was tapped in the first place the first time you
tested it, then all subsequent comparisons thereafter are of little use
because you cant compare a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; like with a &ldquo;tapped&rdquo; line.</p>

<p>However, that factor doesnt render a TDR test completely useless.  One
does not necessarily rely solely on the technique of comparison from one
time to another.  Other methods exist for using the TDR which are a
combination of tracing the line physically with the TDR from the demarc
point inwards to the telephone instruments and physically searching the
line for taps/splices in conjunction with the use of voltmeters or
telephone analyzers to search for imbalanced loops, or imbalanced lines
to ground, crossed line pairs as well as suspicious line impedances.
Likewise, the search should occur from the demarc point outwards towards
the telephone company as far as one can go. The search should extend out
the end of the customers property,  but a countermeasures technician who
does not mind breaking a few laws might feel free to extend the test
point up to the neighborhood cross connect cabinets where the
distribution cable meets the feeders.</p>

<p>[note 1]</p>

<p>In surveillance lingo, the word &ldquo;AUDIO&rdquo; is often used as opposed to the
word &ldquo;SOUND&rdquo; or &ldquo;CONVERSATION&rdquo;. The meanings are almost synonymous,
but their is a slight difference.  The word &ldquo;audio&rdquo; is used because it
denotes any type of intelligence which could be collected and is not
limited to intercepting spoken conversations (spoken words).</p>

<p>[note 2]</p>

<p>Even encryption (phone scramblers) should not be considered secure as
they can be compromised rather easily by simply bypassing the encryption
altogether through modification of the telephone instrument by the
eavesdropper, or by simply liberating the code keys from the unit.</p>

<h1>WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU AND ME</h1>

<p>One may ponder the question of  &ldquo;what the hell does this article have
to do at all with me?&rdquo;
How does this concern you if you don&rsquo;t run a company?
How does this concern you if you are not doing anything illegal?
How does this conern you if you believe your not a target being watched?</p>

<p>I have no answer. Take from this article what you will. It is provided
for informational purposes. I have discussed not only quite a bit about
surveillance as well as countermeasures, but also the some of the terms
which is used by people who work in that field. These are terms which you
may run across one day if you work in the field of general security, and
you will thusly be able to speak a bit more authoritatively to your
colleagues who may not know much about espionage.</p>

<p>But if you have any respect for your own privacy, then you should heed
some of the advice discussed herein.</p>

<p>You need not be a corporate executive to realize the need not only for your
privacy but the need to recognize how many people by their own acts
contribute to the privacy violations. They do this by using cordless phones,
cellular phones, by using paging beepers and even by holding confidential
conversations on unsecured phone lines instead of in person.</p>

<p>I write this specific article for those people on computer bulletin
board systems, and this is aimed SPECIFICALLY at those who refer to
themselves as &ldquo;computer hackers&rdquo;   or  &ldquo;telephone phreaks&rdquo;. If you do not recognize the value in this article then you are a great fool indeed.</p>

<p>Remember folks. Paranoia is our friend. You never know who is watching
or listening.   Always assume the worst and thusly disclose the least
you can; even to so-called friends.</p>

<hr />

<p>Never discuss anything illegal over a telephone be it landline or cordless.</p>

<p>Never keep any incriminating material at your home. Or at the very least
any such information if illegal, should not be &lsquo;feloniously&rsquo; illegal.</p>

<p>Never discuss any majorly illegal acts (in my book thats defined as anything
thats a felony) with anyone else, even friends. And if you do, then you
should be sufficiently vague and even intentionally misleading to your
friends so as to give the eavesdroppers &ldquo;misiformation&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Never disclose to any friend the full capabilities of your power, your
knowledge, etc. If necessary intentionally mislead those friends by
overstating or understating your capabilities or knowledge in order to
feed misinformation to an eavesdropper. This can be done to &ldquo;spook&rdquo; your
eavesdropper and make them enact a move prematurely, or to make them
believe what you want them to believe for whatever reason you see fit.
In addition, feed just enough thruthfull information so as to &lsquo;whet the
appetite&rsquo; of the eavesdropper and not give away your conversation as
total obvious misinformation.</p>
