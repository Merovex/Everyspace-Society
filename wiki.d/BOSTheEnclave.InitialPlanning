text=The Delta server will open in November, 2007. Therefore, we need to build membership and plan our activities. Visit this page at least daily if you are to be a member so we can properly coordinate.%0a%0aDelta 0!%0a%0a>>note%3c%3c%0aIf you have not already, [[http://espacesociety.org/forum/|join the forum.]]%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a'''Important! One base to a Region!''' That is, put only one of your bases in a region, unless there is a Crystal---which justifies a second base. This allows us to establish greater control over the galaxy, easier reinforcement of your future teams, and reduced likelihood of having all bases farmed by a rival.%0a%0aThis page provides the initial planning for The Enclave. Please read the [[AstroEmpires/Guild Policy]] for background on how we intend to run the guild. At its essence, this guild will work in close teams using a hierarchical structure. The leadership will comprise five leaders who will each have some autonomy, but who also work together for large issues.%0a%0a(:*toc:)%0a%0aThis is Brotherhood of Steel: The Enclave, the third guild of the BOS franchise. We have been given D36--D39 to occupy and dominate. However, those are likely not going to be starting galaxies, so we need to decide on which four adjacent galaxies to occupy.%0a%0aWe anticipate that experienced players from Alpha, Beta and Ceti will likewise settle there. So, it won't necessarily be that genteel. We are the Sooners of American History.%0a%0aI need 20 more players to form the leadership core. We have four galaxies to control, which means I would like to form four Sections. Each section needs five core leaders. I'll need others to take special roles (although you can dual-hat). Naturally, more than 20 players is encouraged.%0a%0aPlease show your preference below (1--4). I will target 3 as it will allow me to move fleet up to 1 & 2 rather easily and down to 4. When making your preference, please consider those who are planning on being there, too. I will need you to work closely with those players (especially the leaders); so buddy up. %0a%0aEnclave Enrollment%0a==================%0a%0aThe 20 players we need will comprise 4 fleet leaders and 16 section%0aleaders. Initially, the fleet leaders will probably be section leaders%0aand the section leaders will be in sections. As membership grows, these%0aleaders will flesh out their own teams and elevate to Section Lead.%0a%0aCurrent Enrollment%0a------------------%0a%0aThe list below shows the galaxy, player count and members who will settle in that galaxy. When applying to join The Enclave, please state which galaxy you would like to occupy. Also, please state whether you are interested in working with a small team as a team leader, a group of teams as a section leader, or work within a team. Ben Wilson will make the final assignments, but it helps to know where you are inclined.%0a%0a%25red%25'''Updated Daily or Hourly'''%0a%0a>>note%3c%3c%0aIn the likely event there is only D00--D19, we need to agree on which four galaxies to occupy. I think D12--D15. The sign up below has been detached from the actual galaxy. Assume we will base in four adjacent galaxies. There are two contingency plans below If there are more than 19 galaxies, we will occupy the last four. If there are 19 galaxies, main BOS will occupy D16--D19 and we will occupy D12-15%0a%0a'''Check here before you create your account to find which galaxies are the final assignment.'''%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a||!

Please keep trying to set your account.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aTotal: 19%0a%0aMembership Drive%0a----------------%0a%0aOnce you've signed up with us, please help us find other quality players from within BOS who have not already committed to the other two franchises. The closer to 20 players (21 including Ben Wilson) we are, the more likely we are to have a solid leadership team in place as the guild fleshes out to 100. We reserve the right to be selective with the membership, but hope to embrace all who are interested.%0a%0aAre we limited to twenty players? Not at all. The present assumption is that a Section leader will manage 20 players, which should be enough to dominate a galaxy. We have four galaxies assigned. That means we need four Sections, which each comprise four Teams. If we could add another motivated team of 5, then we could try to take D35. However, I would like saturation as much as possible.%0a%0aNaturally, if you would like to join in a non-leadership role, you are more than welcome. There are a few other administrative roles that will be important.%0a%0aForum%0a=====%0a%0aWe expect members to join the BOS Central forum. However, I would also like members to join the [[http://espacesociety.org/forum|E-Space Forum]], which is presently dedicated to this guild. When Delta opens, membership in that forum will be used to control access to guild wiki pages.%0a%0aOnce you have applied for an account on the forum, PM me so I can identify the account with you, and activate the account.%0a%0aPlanning Goals%0a==============%0a%0aOnce in the forum, we will be discussing a few lessons learned from the BOS/SYN war and ways that we can optimize our experience on Delta. I hope that when The Enclave is beset by war, that we will quickly humble our opponents.%0a%0aWe need to discuss:%0a* Organization%0a* Leadership roles%0a* Guild policy%0a* Upgrading memberships to full year.%0a* Cooperation during first week.%0a%0a----%0a%0aOn behalf of the BOS franchise, I thank you for your participation in The Enclave and faith (or curiosity) in my leadership. I would like you to know that while I think plans are sometimes useless, planning is invaluable. I anticipate Delta to bring its own challenges that we can surmount by working together.%0a%0a(:comment This page has been edited using Pywe:)

The present assumption is that a Section leader will manage 20 players, which should be enough to dominate a galaxy. We have four galaxies assigned.

diff:1194874737:1194874737:=1,30d0%0a%3c The Delta server will open in November, 2007. Therefore, we need to build membership and plan our activities. Visit this page at least daily if you are to be a member so we can properly coordinate.%0a%3c %0a%3c This page provides the initial planning for The Enclave. Please read the [[AstroEmpires/Guild Policy]] for background on how we intend to run the guild. At its essence, this guild will work in close teams using a hierarchical structure. The leadership will comprise five leaders who will each have some autonomy, but who also work together for large issues.%0a%3c %0a%3c This is Brotherhood of Steel: The Enclave, the third guild of the BOS franchise. We have been given D36--D39 to occupy and dominate. We anticipate that experienced players from Alpha, Beta and Ceti will likewise settle there. So, it won't necessarily be that genteel. We are the Sooners of American History.%0a%3c %0a%3c I need 20 more players to form the leadership core. We have four galaxies to control, which means I would like to form four Sections. Each section needs five core leaders. I'll need others to take special roles (although you can dual-hat). Naturally, more than 20 players is encouraged.%0a%3c %0a%3c Please show your preference below (D36--D39). I will target D38 as it will allow me to move fleet up to D36 & D37 rather easily and down to D39. When making your preference, please consider those who are planning on being there, too. I will need you to work closely with those players (especially the leaders); so buddy up. %0a%3c %0a%3c Current Distribution%0a%3c ====================%0a%3c %0a%3c The list below shows the galaxy, player count and members who will settle in that galaxy. When applying to join The Enclave, please state which galaxy you would like to occupy. Also, please state whether you are interested in working with a small team as a team leader, a group of teams as a section leader, or work within a team. Ben Wilson will make the final assignments, but it helps to know where you are inclined.%0a%3c %0a%3c ||D36|| 1 ||(Slighterman)||%0a%3c ||D37|| 1.5 ||(Jsrazz, Moob?)||%0a%3c ||D38|| 1.5 ||(Ben Wilson, Moob?)||%0a%3c ||D39|| 1 ||(Paul)||%0a%3c %0a%3c :'''Others Deciding''':Zookie, Rebelshadow, Jekel, Sphinx30, EmperorGeorge1.%0a%3c %0a%3c Forum%0a%3c =====%0a%3c %0a%3c We expect members to join the BOS Central forum. However, I would also like members to join the [[http://espacesociety.org/forum|E-Space Forum]], which is presently dedicated to this guild. When Delta opens, membership in that forum will be used to control access to guild wiki pages.%0a%3c %0a%3c Once you have applied for an account on the forum, PM me so I can identify the account with you, and activate the account.%0a%3c %0a%3c On behalf of the BOS franchise, I thank you for your participation in The Enclave and faith (or curiosity) in my leadership.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
