In December 2004, we resumed and this site was built. In January 2005, we began tinkering with a Lexicon called the [[Macropedia]]. We weren't sure what to expect, but in the first five months we produced over one-hundred articles detailing the period known as the Imperium. The structure of the Lexicon has helped us keep going.%0a> %0a> On June 30, 2005, we finished our first run through the Lexicon. We wrote over 100 entries during that time. Since then, we have begun to go back through the various letters to complete the phantom entries that we created and were not able to write under the rules of the game.%0a> %0a
